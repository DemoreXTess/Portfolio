# Top-Ranked Web3 Auditor | DemoreXTess (aka TessKimy)

## Hello there!ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **DemoreXTess**, known as **TessKimy** on the [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/TessKimy) platformâ€”a dedicated Web3 security researcher with a strong foothold in DeFi, particularly lending protocols and mathematically intensive systems. Backed by a solid mathematical foundation, I specialize in dissecting complex logic and uncovering subtle flaws across smart contract infrastructures. While I primarily focus on audits on [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/TessKimy), I also contribute to security contests on platforms like [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/u/DemoreXTess), [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/@DemoreX), and [Codehawks](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/). Some of my notable results include 4th place finishes in high-profile Sherlock contests such as Chilliz, Beraborrow, and Peapods. My work has consistently placed me among the top ranks in competitive audits on platforms like [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/TessKimy), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/u/DemoreXTess), [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/@DemoreX), [Codehawks](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/), with notable results such as 4th place finishes in major contests like [Chilliz](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/550), [Beraborrow](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/741), and [Peapods](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/749). Whether itâ€™s CDPs, staking mechanics, or cross-chain designs, I bring a sharp, analytical edge to every protocol I audit.
